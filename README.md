# Scheduler-NJE

Sick of all those freemium scheduler apps with unskippable ads and banners in the app store? Looking for an option that's truly free, open-source, browser-based, and really profoundly BAD? You've come to the right place!

This was a project for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp. You're free to use this one however you'd like, but it's probably not the best option out there. It's pretty limited, obviously. Still, I hope you enjoy it in any way you can.
